title: Blog Post 3 - Web Scraping
---

In this post, I will use webscraping to extract and process data from the IMBD website to find out what movie or TV shows share actors with my favorite movie or show to recommend my next film to watch.

The link to the GitHub repository for this scraper project.

I will use the movie `Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi` as an example of my favorite movie. So the idea of this movie recommender systems works is based on if I enjoyed the movie Star Wars, and some other movies or TV shows have many of the same actors as the movie I like, then I might also like that movie.

## §1.  Setup

Before doing webscraping, we need to make sure we have installed the Python package `scrapy`. In my case, I installed to my PIC16B environment by using `Anaconda`. Then we can start to set up our project by running the command line `scrapy startproject your_project_name` to set up a new scrapy project directory. 

Once I open my terminal and navigate to the location where I would like to do my scrapy project. Then I run the following command line:

``` python
conda activate PIC16B
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
```

The above command line will create an `IMDB_scraper` directory as the name for my project; then we have our directory structure like this:

```
└── IMDB_scraper
    ├── scrapy.cfg
    └── IMDB_scraper
        ├── spiders
        │   └── __init__.py
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── middlewares.py
        ├── settings.py
        ├── items.py
        └── pipelines.py
```

We should start our project with ` cd IMDB_scraper` to get in the correct `IMDB_scraper` directory.

Next, we can add the line `CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20` to our `settings.py` file to prevent our scraper from downloading too much data while we’re still testing things out. We’ll remove this line later once we finish testing our project.


## §2. Spider

In this section we will write our scraper 

Now, let's create a file called `imdb_spider.py` inside the `spiders` director and type in the following code in `imdb_spider.py`.


```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    # The URL is for 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi' from IMDB page
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/']
```

The above code creates a subclass called `ImdbSpider` which inherits from Spider class from the package scrapy. 

 - `name` variable is used to call different spiders from the terminal; we should give the unique name for each different spider.
 - `start_urls` is the list of URLs to tell where our spider starts to crawl from. In my case, my start URL will navigate to the IMBD movie page for `Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi`. You can replace the entry of start_urls with the URL corresponding to any of your favorite movie or TV show.

Next, I will implement three parsing method for the `ImdbSpider` class.

### First parse method: parse( )

The first method is `parse(self, response)`; this method usually parses the response argument. The parse method is the most important method in our Spider project; this method specifies what should happen when the Spider encounters a `response`. A `response` is an object corresponding to a webpage; it contains the raw HTML and many other useful attributes and methods for extracting information from the page.


```python
def parse(self, response):
       """
       This function starting at the website 'https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' 
       for the movie 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi' from IMDB;
       then navigate to the Cast & Crew page with URL of the form
       'https://start_urls/fullcredits/'
       """

       # get the link for the Cast & Crew page (fullcredits/)
       # Notes: No slash at the begining of the path "fullcredits/"
       next_link = response.css('div.SubNav__SubNavContentBlock-sc-11106ua-2 ul.ipc-inline-list a').attrib['href']
       # join the link of the Cast & Crew page to our current URL path
       # hers is : https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/fullcredits/
       cast_link = response.urljoin(next_link)

       # yield a request to follow the Cast & Crew page,
       # and call the method parse_full_credits() once get there
       yield Request(cast_link, callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

In order to get the URL for navigation to the Cast & Crew page, we need to use the **Developer Tools** on our browser to inspect individual HTML elements. For example, I right-click on the Cast & Crew link on the Mac computer, then click Inspect Element. Then you will see some similar page like this:


<img src="/images/blog_post3_images/1.png" alt="blog_post3_image">

Then we can find that the link for the Cast & Crew page is `fullcredits/`, and is inside the anchor tag `<a>...</a>` with `href` attribute.
Then we can notice that the `fullcredits/` is under the `ul` element with class name `ipc-inline-list`; and that `ul` elements is under the `div` element with class name `SubNav__SubNavContentBlock-sc-11106ua-2`. So we can use `response.css('div.SubNav__SubNavContentBlock-sc-11106ua-2 ul.ipc-inline-list a').attrib['href']` to get the **first** value from the attribute `href` inside the attribute `a`.                                     

We can use `scrapy shell` to check:

First, run

```shell
scrapy shell 'https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/'
```

Then run:

```shell
response.css('div.SubNav__SubNavContentBlock-sc-11106ua-2 ul.ipc-inline-list a').attrib['href']
```

After that,  you will get something like this:

```shell
In [1]: response.css('div.SubNav__SubNavContentBlock-sc-11106ua-2 ul.ipc-inline-list a').attrib['href']
Out[1]: 'fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ql_cl'
```

Great, we can see that we have successfully extracted the `fullcredits/`.

---

### Second parse parsing method: parse_full_credits( )

The method `parse_full_credits(self, response)` starts at our movie's Cast & Crew page; find all names under the Series Cast section on that page, then navigate to each actor/actress page.


```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
       """
       This function pareses the Full Cast & Crew page
       of the movie from URL the 'https://start_urls/fullcredits/',
       then navigate to each actors page (Crew members are not included).
       """
       
       # list of links for negative to each actor page (ex: '/name/nm0000434/')
       # Notes: There is a slash at the begining of the path "/name/nm0000434/"
       links = [a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]
       
       # for all actors on the current page,
       # yield a request to follow those actor's link,
       # and call the method parse_actor_page () when each actor’s page is reached
       for link in links:
          # add the base URL (https://www.imdb.com) to each actor's link (ex: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000434/)
          url= response.urljoin(link)
          yield Request(url, callback= self.parse_actor_page)
```

Let's use the developer tool to inspect the first actor element inside the Cast & Crew page to get some idea of how to extract all actor/actress links. In my case, I inspect the actor called "Mark Hamill"; then you will get something similar to this:

<img src="/images/blog_post3_images/2.png" alt="blog_post3_image">

After inspection, we can notice that all links are inside the table row with `<td>` tag with the class name primary_photo; inside that row, we have an `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute, which contains the link we need. Therefor, we can use list comprehension `[a.attrib["href"] for a in response.css("td.primary_photo a")]` to get all the actor/actress link.

---

### Third parse method: parse_actor_page( )

The method `parse_actor_page(self, response)` starts at each actor/actress page, gets the actor/actress's name, then extracts all movie or TV show names inside the `Actor/Actress` under Filmography section.


```python
    def parse_actor_page(self, response):
       """
       This function get each actor's page,
       It should yield a dictionary with the name of the actor and the name of each movie or TV show   
       """
       # get the actor's name
       actor_name = response.css('span.itemprop ::text').get()

       # a list contains all movies or TV shows name for the current page's actor
       # male is under actor
       # female is under actress
       filmography_actor = [actor_name.css("a::text").get() for actor_name in response.css('div.filmo-row') if actor_name.css("[id^=actor]") or actor_name.css("[id^=actress]")]
       # for all movie or TV show name on this actor's page, 
       # yield one dictionary contains the actor's name and each movie or TV show
       for movie_or_TV_name in filmography_actor:
        yield{
           "actor" : actor_name,
           "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name
        }
```

In my case, I use the developer tool to inspect the actor's "Mark Hamil" name to find the idea of how to extract any actor/actress's name.

<img src="/images/blog_post3_images/3.png" alt="blog_post3_image">

The name is located at `<span>` tag with class name `itemprop`, so we can use `response.css('span.itemprop ::text').get()` method to extract the name.
we added `::text` to the CSS query, to allow us extract only the text elements directly inside `<span>` element with the name `itemprop `. "Using `.get()` directly on a SelectorList instance avoids an IndexError and returns None when it doesn’t find any element matching the selection."

I used the list comprehension get all movie or TV show names from the current page:

```python
[actor_name.css("a::text").get() for actor_name in response.css('div.filmo-row') if actor_name.css("[id^=actor]") or actor_name.css("[id^=actress]")]
```

I noticed that **males** are under **Actor**, and **females** are under **Actress** in their corresponding Filmography section.

Then we should use the developer tool to inspect the movie or TV show name:

<img src="/images/blog_post3_images/4.png" alt="blog_post3_image">

We can see the name of the movie is inside the `<a>` tag, under the `<div>` tag with class name `filmo-row`; However, more than one class has the same name; So, we need to check the `id` to get the correct data. Therefore, we should add if condition to check the `id`, which starts with `actor` or `actress`; thus, I added `if actor_name.css("[id^=actor]") or actor_name.css("[id^=actress]")` inside the list comprehension.

---

Good, now we can use our `imdb_spider` to crawl the data by running the command:

```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```

The above command will create a CSV file called `results` with a column for actors and a column for movies or TV shows inside my `IMDB_scraper` director.

## §3. Make Your Recommendations

In this section, I will use the data from `results.csv`, then make my next movie recommendations.

Don't gorget to comment out the line `CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT = 20` in the file `settings.py`. Then we should run the command `scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv` again to get the complete data. 

I will import the required Python modules at begging for convenience.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotly import express as px
```

Next cell will import the `results.csv` as a Pandas DataFrame called `results`.


```python
results = pd.read_csv("results.csv")
```

Once I have read the results dataset into a pandas dataframe, we can take a look at the first five rows of the dataset using `results.head()`.


```python
results.head()
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor</th>
      <th>movie_or_TV_name</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Stacie Nichols</td>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Stacie Nichols</td>
      <td>Under the Rainbow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Carole Morris</td>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Carole Morris</td>
      <td>Under the Rainbow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Barbara O'Laughlin</td>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



In the next cell, I will count the occurrence of the movie or TV name by using the `groupby()` and aggregation function.


```python
df = results.groupby(["movie_or_TV_name"]).aggregate(len)
df
```


<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>actor</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>movie_or_TV_name</th>
      <th></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>'Allo 'Allo!</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...And Mother Makes Five</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...And the Band Played On</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>.COM</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>10 Rillington Place</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Zevo-3</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Zomb-G: Get Bit or Get Ate</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Zombie Gang Bangers</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Zorro</th>
      <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>iMurders</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>4179 rows × 1 columns</p>
</div>



Now, we can compute a sorted list with the top movies and TV shows that share actors with my favorite movie or TV show, then use `reset_index()` to recover the actor column. Finally, we should rename our column names by using `df.rename()` method.


```python
df = df.sort_values(by="actor", ascending=False).reset_index()
df = df.rename(columns = {"movie_or_TV_name" : "movie", "actor" : "number of shared actors"})
df
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>movie</th>
      <th>number of shared actors</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</td>
      <td>217</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</td>
      <td>39</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>The Bill</td>
      <td>32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Under the Rainbow</td>
      <td>31</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Doctor Who</td>
      <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>...</th>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4174</th>
      <td>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4175</th>
      <td>Joe and Max</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4176</th>
      <td>John Adams</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4177</th>
      <td>John and Julie</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4178</th>
      <td>iMurders</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>4179 rows × 2 columns</p>
</div>



Next, we can find out the top ten movies and TV shows that share actors with my favorite movie or TV show.


```python
df[:10]
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>movie</th>
      <th>number of shared actors</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</td>
      <td>217</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</td>
      <td>39</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>The Bill</td>
      <td>32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>Under the Rainbow</td>
      <td>31</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Doctor Who</td>
      <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>5</th>
      <td>Willow</td>
      <td>21</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>6</th>
      <td>Casualty</td>
      <td>19</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>7</th>
      <td>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</td>
      <td>18</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>8</th>
      <td>The Dark Crystal</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>9</th>
      <td>Labyrinth</td>
      <td>16</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



From the list above, I notice the number one movie is `Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi` since most shows will “share” the most actors with themselves; so the next movie I should check out is `Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back` or `The Bill`.

---

We can use `plotly` to draw a histogram of movies that share at least 20 actors and exclude the film `Episode VI - Return of the Jedi.`

In the next cell, we should clean our data.


```python
df_2 = results.copy()
df_2['count'] = results.groupby(["movie_or_TV_name"]).transform(len)
# remove the movie Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
df_2 = df_2[df_2['movie_or_TV_name'] != 'Episode VI - Return of the Jedi']
# get movies that share at least 20 actors
df_2 = df_2[df_2['count'] >= 20].sort_values(by="count", ascending=False).rename(columns = {"movie_or_TV_name" : "movie"})
df_2
```
